/**
 * Steps

    Create a new JavaScript file in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
    Initialize a variable to represent the radius of a circle. For example, you can set radius to a specific value, like 5.
    Calculate the area of the circle using the formula Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2) and store the result in a variable called circleArea.
    Calculate the circumference of the circle using the formula 2 _ Math.PI _ radius and store the result in a variable called circumference.
    Display the results by logging them to the console. You can use console.log to print the area and circumference. For example:


For a circle with a radius of 5 units:

- The area is approximately 78.54 square units.
- The circumference is approximately 31.42 units.

    Run your JavaScript program to see the calculated area and circumference of the circle with the specified radius.

const circleRadius = 5;

const circleArea = Math.PI * Math.pow(circleRadius, 2);
